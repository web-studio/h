“This idea of anticipation is key to investing and to business generally. You can’t wait for an opportunity to become obvious.

“As long as you enjoy investing, you’ll be willing to do the homework and stay in the game.

If you personalize these losses, you can’t trade.”</br><strong>Bruce Kovner (Net Worth $4.3 Billion)</strong>

“The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell.”</br><strong>John Templeton (Net Worth $20 Billion)</strong>
